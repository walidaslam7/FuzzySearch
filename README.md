# Fuzzy Search

Fuzzy search is a type of search algorithm that is used to find results even when the user's query contains errors, misspellings, or partial matches. It is particularly useful when dealing with large and complex datasets, or when users are not sure of the exact spelling or phrasing of the information they are searching for.

The key feature of fuzzy search is its ability to find results that are similar to, but not exactly the same as, the query entered by the user. This is achieved by using techniques such as approximate string matching, phonetic matching, and partial matching.

For example, a fuzzy search algorithm might return results for a query like "Pythom" when the correct spelling is "Python," or it might return results for a query like "John Smi" when the correct spelling is "John Smith."

There are several different fuzzy search algorithms that can be used, including the Levenshtein distance algorithm, the Jaro-Winkler distance algorithm, and the Soundex algorithm. Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the specific requirements of the search application.
In this repository you will find ```.NET Soundex```


In SQL, the Soundex algorithm is implemented as a function called SOUNDEX. The SOUNDEX function takes a string argument and returns a four-character code representing the Soundex value of the input string.

For example, the Soundex code for the name "Smith" is S530, while the code for the name "Smythe" is also S530. By using the Soundex function in a SQL query, we can search for all records that have names that sound similar to "Smith", including records with the name "Smythe", "Smithe", and "Smath".

Here's an example SQL query that uses the SOUNDEX function to search for records with names similar to "Smith":

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable
WHERE SOUNDEX(name) = SOUNDEX('Smith')

```

Overall, fuzzy search is a powerful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of search applications, especially in cases where users may not know the exact terms they are searching for or when dealing with large and complex datasets.
